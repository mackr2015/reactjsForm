## Contact Form Build Test Job

- Make a Contact Form following the [design Mockup](https://www.figma.com/file/6SUiFvzunMy5fBVxHLXxZ5/Century-21?type=design&node-id=1-2&mode=design) and below Requirements
- Develop and implement a basic contact page for a website. The form should allow users to enter their name, email address, phone number, and message. Upon submission, the data should be sent to a backend server for processing.

### Requirements

**Frontend**
- Create a simple HTML form with fields for name, email address, phone number, and message.
- Implement basic client-side validation to ensure the required fields are filled, and validate the email address and phone number formats.
- Display a success message or an error message based on the server's response.
- The map section should be integrated with Google Maps. Tabs and map pinpoints are connected to each other. When a user clicks on a pinpoint, the corresponding tab should become active and data should be displayed below. When a user clicks on the tabs, the corresponding pinpoint should become active.
- If possible, please do not use Tailwind, or Bootstrap libraries so that we can see your frontend skills more when it comes to classes, structure, styling, etc. However, if it takes more time, then please use the stack you want.

**Backend**
- Handle form submissions.
- Validate the received data and ensure all required fields are present.
- Send an email to the recipient with the form data or store it in a database.
- Return an appropriate response to the front end indicating success or failure.

**Additionally**
- You are free to choose any programming languages, frameworks, and libraries for both frontend and backend development.
- Select a method for sending emails, such as using an SMTP library, PHP mail(), or a third-party email service.
- Implement basic error handling and validation.

**Additional Considerations (optional but desirable)**
- Implement server-side validation for email address format and protection against potential malicious input.
- Provide visual feedback to the user while the form is being submitted or processed.
- Store the submitted form data in a database for future reference.
- If time permits, please make the page at least a bit responsive to ensure it is mobile-friendly to some degree, doesn't need to be super perfect at this stage since it is a test job.


**Evaluation Criteria: Your work will be evaluated based on the following criteria:**
- Correctness and functionality of the solution.
- Design choices and adherence to best practices in both frontend and backend development.
- Error handling and validation.
- User experience.
- Code quality, including pixel-perfect HTML design, and maintainability.
